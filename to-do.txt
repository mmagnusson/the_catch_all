Things to try
---------------


I've been having a blast using Numpy, Sklearn and TensorFlow to analyze music. I have an algorithm for classifying music by genre. And another to predict if I will like new music.
Basically I read the first minute of every song. Convert that to a wav file. Read the wav file into numpy. I then use Fourier transforms on these arrays. Use k best selection to determine the best frequencies to use for classifying the music and reduce the data down to 100 floats. Those 100 floats are then feed into a TensorFlow model and trained to predict genres.

Databases:
	MongoDB
	MySQL
		MariaDB -> fork of MySQL?
	Postgres -> 
	Cassandra -> distributed, scalable


---------------
Testing:

	pytest (lib?)
	Code coverage
	Continuous integration (Travis?  Jarvis?)


----------------
Web servers:

	Apache
	Nginx
	hosting tests and test code/sites
